# Prompt

Finally, this is what you need to do.

For reference, remember part 1 of this assignment involved reviewing this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0a7PwRNLVU.

For this assignment I want you to do some independent research on Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS). Here is the wikipedia page - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS. You can also use ChatGPT, other google resources, etc. Other keywords that can help you are hypermedia.

After you grasp some of these concepts, please do the following:

Make some proposals to change the APIs above to incorporate hypermedia into the design of our voting application. Note I dont want you creating new APIs (stick to the 3 above), but describe how you would change the API structures to better support a hypermedia driven approach. Note you can add additional fields to support the hypermedia concepts or change existing fields.
Write a brief description of how these APIs would work together a little better using these concepts. Focus on the perspective of the user of your API, how would this better support the interactions between the APIs supporting an application?
Provide at least 2 references that you found helpful during this activity. Note you dont need to formally cite them, just a link would be OK.
